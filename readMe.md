# MERN Stack Skills Test

This repository is a self-assessment test to measure your level of proficiency in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
It is structured into progressive parts, from beginner to advanced.

---

## How It Works
- Work through each section in order.
- Answer the **theory questions** and attempt the **practical coding challenges**.
- Evaluate yourself using the **scoring guide** at the bottom.

You can use this test for practice, interview prep, or to track your progress as you learn MERN.

---

## Part 1 – Core JavaScript & Node.js
1. Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`.  
2. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns only the even ones.  
3. In Node.js, what is the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** code?  
4. Write a Node.js script to read a file and log its contents to the console.

---

## Part 2 – Express.js Backend
1. Create a minimal Express server that listens on port 5000 and responds with `"Hello World"` at `/`.  
2. Explain what `req` and `res` are in Express.  
3. Build an Express route `/api/users` that returns a hardcoded list of users in JSON format.  
4. Explain what middleware is and give an example.

---

## Part 3 – MongoDB & Mongoose
1. Describe the difference between a **document** and a **collection** in MongoDB.  
2. Write a Mongoose schema for a `User` with `name`, `email`, and `password`.  
3. Write code to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.  
4. Write a query to find all users where `name` contains `"John"`.

---

## Part 4 – React (Frontend)
1. What’s the difference between a **functional component** and a **class component** in React?  
2. Build a React component with a form that collects a user’s `name` and displays it below after submission.  
3. Explain the difference between **state** and **props**.  
4. How do you make an API call from a React component, and where would you put it?

---

## Part 5 – Full Stack Integration
**Challenge:**  
Build a small MERN app where:
- Backend: Express API with MongoDB storing users.
- Frontend: React app that fetches the user list from the backend and displays it.
- Bonus: Add a form to create new users and save them to MongoDB.

---

## Scoring Guide
- **Beginner:** Can answer ~50% of Part 1–3 but struggles with full integration.  
- **Intermediate:** Can complete Parts 1–4 and make a basic working full stack app.  
- **Advanced:** Can complete all parts quickly, write clean code, handle errors, and deploy to a service like Vercel/Render.
